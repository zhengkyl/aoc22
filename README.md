# Advent of Code 2022

More practice with rust.

Code that looks half-decent is _heavily_ "inspired" by solutions found at https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code#rust and this person in particular https://github.com/ephemient/aoc2022/tree/main/rs who seems to know what they're doing.

If it looks like garbage, I probably wrote it mostly myself.

## Running

Set your session cookie as the `SESSION` variable in a `.env` file at the project root or load it into your environment.

```sh
cargo run <DAY>
```

## Test against sample data

```sh
cargo test <DAY>
```
